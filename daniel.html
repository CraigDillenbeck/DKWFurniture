			<p class="quote">"Give the boys good pocket knives, and what is better, give them a good workshop. Employed in it, they will not only be kept out of mischief, but they will be strengthening their muscles, exercising their mental powers, and fitting themselves for greater usefulness, when they shall be called upon to take their place in the ranks of men."</p>

				Daniel's passion for building furniture blooms from a lifelong curiosity of 'how things work'. Continually keeping his hands dirty, Daniel learned at a very young age there is a tremendous learning experience with disassembling and reassembling all sorts of objects. Working with wood came naturally as has lived in the Western North Carolina mountains his entire life.<br><br>
				Honing his interests in high school in a wide range of crafting classes including woods, leathers, and clay lead him to enrolling in Appalachian State University's Furniture Manufacturing program, which he completed in 2005.<br><br>
				Daniel resides in Boone, NC with his wife, Brenna, and their three children, Josiah, Noah, and Tessa. If you would like to share comments, inquiries, or ideas about projects you have in mind, please contact Daniel via:<br><br>
